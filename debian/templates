_Description: Auto update lxc2 configuration format to lxc3?
 LXC 3 comes with many changes for containers' configuration files.
 It also comes with a binary `/usr/bin/lxc-update-config` that allows
 one to update his configuration.
 .
 This job can be done either automatically now or manually later.

 Unpriviledged containers configurations will have to be updated manually
 either way via the `/usr/bin/lxc-update-config` command.
