Description: Linux Containers userspace tools
 Containers are insulated areas inside a system, which have their own namespace
 for filesystem, network, PID, IPC, CPU and memory allocation and which can be
 created using the Control Group and Namespace features included in the Linux
 kernel.
 .
 This package provides the lxc-* tools, which can be used to start a single
 daemon in a container, or to boot an entire "containerized" system, and to
 manage and debug your containers.

Description: Linux Containers userspace tools (test binaries)
 Containers are insulated areas inside a system, which have their own namespace
 for filesystem, network, PID, IPC, CPU and memory allocation and which can be
 created using the Control Group and Namespace features included in the Linux
 kernel.
 .
 This package contains the test binaries. Those binaries are primarily
 used for autopkgtest and by some developers. They are not meant to be
 installed on regular user systems.

Description: PAM module for managing cgroups for LXC
 LXCFS provides a FUSE based filesystem to improve the LXC experience
 within the containers.
 .
 This provides a Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) to provide
 logged-in users with a set of cgroups which they can administer.
 This allows for instance unprivileged containers, and session
 management using cgroup process tracking.
